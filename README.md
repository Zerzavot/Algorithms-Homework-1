1. Given a set of M positive integers A = a 1 , . . . , a M , develop an dynamic programming that finds a partition A 1 , A 2 such that | S 1 − S 2 | is minimized, where S i is the sum of elements in A i . 2. Given bit strings X = x 1 x m , Y = y 1 y n , and Z = z 1 z m+n , if Z can be obtained by interleaving the bits in X and Y in a way that it maintains the left-to-right order of the bits in X and Y , then we say Z is an interleaving of X and Y . For example if X = 101 and Y = 01 , then Z = 10011 is an interleaving of X and Y , but Z = 11010 is not. Develop a (dynamic programming) algorithm that determines whether Z is an interleaving of X and Y or not. 3. Given an array of size n that has the following specifications: – each element in the array contains either a policeman or a thief – each policeman can catch only one thief – policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than K units away from the policeman Devise a greedy algorithm that finds the maximum number of thieves that can be caught. Also, prove that your algorithm satisfies the greedy-choice property. For the array [ P, T, T, P, T ] and k = 1, your algorithm should output 2 (first policeman catches first thief and second one catches either second or third thief) For the array [ T, T, P, P, T, P ] and k = 2 your algorithm should output 3. 4. Given a set of n activities A 1 , . . . , A n with the starting and finishing time (s i , f i ) assigned to each activity and a number of rooms in which activities are performed. Develop a greedy algorithm that assign all the activities to minimum number of rooms so that no two overlapping activities are performed in same room. Also, prove that your algorithm satisfies the greedy-choice property.
